# Intro

Hi I'm Jake. I've been working on software in many different since about the year of 2000.

I started in software because I really enjoyed video games. I went to Iowa State and graduated with Bachelor's degree in Computer Science. At Iowa State and worked in multiple Computer Science Teaching Assistant roles and had internships at Intermec for a summer and Kingland Systems for about 2 years. I was very fortunate to meet and learn from many great people at each stop.

## Technology Services Group (TSG)

I'm a bit of an odd duck in the Computer Science world being an extrovert and enjoying to problem solve and code. The opportunity to start out consulting with Technology Services group was fantastic. It fit what my strengths nicely and was a really great start to my full time professional career. This is going to get repetitive, but the folks at TSG were great. If you're in need of Document Management Solutions I would give the folks at TSG a shout. They know they stuff and are great to work with.

## Vail Systems

A mentor at TSG, Fred Lee, ended bringing to me to Vail System I decided to leave the consulting role at TSG. Fred was convinced this new thing, Rails, was the bees knees. In hindsight and at the time, he was totally right. The change of pace was great only because of Rails, I moved to working with to working with a Mac everyday which was not the norm at the time, building apps from requirements all the way through deployment, focusing on building tech skills to do so and work locally everyday. It was great. Fred ended up moving on at one time and I moved into one of my first management roles.  That was also great, its probably what I've found I can excel in, although at first I made an enormous amount of mistakes. I'm hopefully learning and getting better over the years.

## Enova
My commute and desire to try and start a side gig got me to move on from Vail. I moved into a full time programming role at Enova and learned and enormous amount from Enova and 8th Light developers over the year I was at Enova. Strict TDD and pairing really moved me forward as a developer and I'm very grateful for all the of that learning. Despite that experience, after year, I was enticed by to Vail by Jim.

## Back to Vail Systems
When I moved back to Vail I took on additional responsibility in the consulting arm of the business. This was challenging, I was managing and hiring for an area I knew little about as well as being responsible for the web application developers. After several years and the team growing substantially, from 5 - 20, I changed responsibilites to manage the team and lead a new product for the company, FreeClimb. After a lot of hard work relating to team dynamics, technology and more I'm proud and excited that we have launched the product.

## Today
Today I'm really the leadership roles with our Application Development team and FreeClimb product. The people I get to work with on a day to day basis are amazing and I learn something new everyday. There are many challenges ahead and they are fun to get after everyday.
