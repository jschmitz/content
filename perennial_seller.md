# Perennial Seller


## Top 3 Concepts


### Knowing the target

* Knowing the target (p. 45)
* Service the core audience first and expand outward
* Selling to addicts (50 cent)
* Nothing more badass than the audience of the product being the hero (reminded me of the StoryBoard marketing book)

At the end of the marketing sections principles are discussed related to making decisions.  “Principles are better than instructions or ’hacks’”.  This also stood out.

## Hustle

The message that you need to hustle to find your first core customers resonated. Selling out of your trunk (shoes, CDs), bringing swag to weddings. Getting folks free or cheap stuff so that you can win the long game.  Seth Godin => “You gotta sell one”.  Word of mouth is your best seller.

## Iterate

Take feedback from your target and iterate. Everyone / product needs a coach; even Michael Jordan. Quantity of iteration matter (see Culture Code also).  Studies support quantity of iteration approaches. Must concentrate and sacrifice while iterating through the marathon.

  * Pissing people off is OK


### Positioning

* You need feedback. Everyone needs a coach.  First drafts are bad.

### Marketing

* Peter Thiel – “Customers will not come just because you build it. You have to make that happen and its harder than it looks.”
* Great salesman can sell mediocre products. Product and sales must be brilliant to make the creation last
* Marketing must be a top priority for the creator. Not something to delegate.
* Marketing => Make people care
* Gotta hustle at to get started. Shoes, CDs, books (Phil Knight, JazZ, Holiday)
* Word of mouth is a big deal!
* Seth Godin => “Sell one”
* Find addicts (50 cent)
* Advertising can add fuel to a fire but rarely start one
* Formulas
  * LTV => Lifetime Value
  * CPA => Cost per Acquisition
* Principles are better than instructions or “hacks”
